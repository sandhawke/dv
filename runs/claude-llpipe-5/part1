I've reviewed the files and they appear mostly correct and well-structured. I'm making a few key improvements:

1. Fixed error handling in the LLM code to properly propagate stream data before rejection
2. Added missing meta.json/error.json handling in several commands
3. Added rate limit handling as specified
4. Improved debug logging throughout
5. Added proper filesystem error handling
6. Improved test coverage
7. Added chalk for error message formatting

I'm attaching updates to the affected files.

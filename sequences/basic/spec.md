Carefully study the provided user story or software description and design a unix command line tool the will provide the desired functionality. Think carefully about all the features the software needs to have to meet the likely needs of the user as described.

Now, write a simple and clean specification of that software, briefly stating everything it needs to do. Making all the necessary design decisions, such as option names and output format, using your best understanding of what the user liked wants.

Use console fenced code blocks with examples to help clarify the behavior of the specified software. The code blocks should run in a clean bash shell. Use '...' as a wildcard when needed in the example output.

Use formal languages (eg BNF) and technical jargon when they make the text more clear for an expert reader.

Avoid saying how things will be implemented. This is a functional specification. It should be possible to implement in different languages and with different approaches.

Using the formal specification of the software to be created, as found in docs/specification.md, write a complete bash test suite in multiple simple and clear test/*.sh files.

If you make files in test/* which are not themselves tests to be run, give them names starting with underscore (_).

You can assume the command being tested will be on the PATH, so do not call it with a relative or absolute path.  For example, if the command being tested were "foo", then you could run it like `result=$(foo)`.

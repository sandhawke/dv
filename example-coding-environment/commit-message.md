# Commit message

Any time you are changing the software, tests, specifications, etc, be sure to create a git commit message to go with that change. It should at least have a title, and maybe more details in the body.

Provide the git commit message by putting it in this file: ./_from_developer/commit-message

If you are not changing any files, or only changing files in the _from_developer directory, skip this step.

The test suite provides good coverage of many features, but there are some gaps and areas where additional tests would be valuable. Here's my analysis:

Well Tested Features:
- Basic file attachments and form-data
- Directory traversal with sorting
- Help display
- File size limits and truncation
- Token limits
- Ignore/unignore patterns
- Boundary string incrementing
- Symlink handling
- Preserve timestamps
- Line endings
- MIME types
- Base64 encoding
- Verbosity levels
- Context limits and overflow files

Missing or Could Use Additional Tests:
1. Text prefix/suffix with special characters
2. Directory access permission failures
3. Non-existent input files (fatal error)
4. Empty files
5. Interaction between multiple limits (tokens + bytes)
6. Path canonicalization
7. Config file loading
8. UTF-8 edge cases
9. Complex ignore pattern combinations
10. Color output for verbose modes 3 and 4
11. Overflow file naming format
12. Mixed command inputs (files + key/value + dirs)

I'll create additional tests for these gaps.

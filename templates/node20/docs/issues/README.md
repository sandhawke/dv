Issues go in this directory as markdown files.

Filename should be a kebab case brief summary of the issue, usually phrased as a question, with a .md suffix.

The first line in the file should be either "STATUS=OPEN" or "STATUS=CLOSED". Do not include other lines of that style (lines matching /^[A-Z]+=/).

Otherwise, the file should communicate what the problem is, what some solutions are, a recommended solution, and (if the issue is closed) how it was resolved.

Keep things brief but clear.

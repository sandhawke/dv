The following change was attempted, but it caused a regression on cltests. Specifically these tests stopped working: ${regress[*]}

The changes were not accepted, due to this regression. Let's try to avoid repeating whatever mistakes in this change caused the regression.

At the time of this proposed change, the git log had $count entries.

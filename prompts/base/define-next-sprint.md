Look over the state of this software project and define the next sprint. Create a file called team-notes/sprint.md that specifies exactly what code should be created in the next round of work. Describe any new modules and changes to existing modules. Describe how to approach the unit tests, integration tests, and command line tests (cltests) that will assure us the new code is functioning correctly. The new code should be scoped as  something you can write easily yourself with high confidence of getting it bug free, and which a senior software engineer could write and debug in 2 hours. You may write one or more cltests now which will show off the results of the sprint. Create or update test-this-sprint.sh to run cltest with just the cltest files which demonstrate the new functionality to be added this sprint (either existing cltest files which currently fail or new cltest files you create now.)

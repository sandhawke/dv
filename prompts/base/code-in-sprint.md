As an experienced and meticulous software engineer, carefully study the specs, code, test cases, and test results.

Now we want to continue with the next steps in the sprint, as defined in the attached file team-notes/sprint.md

Note the command line tests (cltests) we are aiming to pass at the end of this sprint, in test-this-sprint.sh, with results in _to_developer.

Be sure there are highly detailed unit tests for any code in the path to a failing command line test.

Please proceed and carefully make the necessary changes in this sprint.

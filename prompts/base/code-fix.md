Attached, please see details on how the current code is failing one or more tests in one of the test suites.

The cltest suite is part of the program specification and must not be changed. For other tests, it is possible the error is in the test, not the program. When in doubt, add variant tests.

Please get the software working properly. You are encouraged to refactor, simplify, extend, or otherwise improve the software in any way that helps it work better.

If cltests are failing, but the unit tests are all working, you should probably add more unit tests, unless the problem is clearly in the command-line interface. It's good for every export from a file to be unit tested, if that's possible without enourmous amounts of code.

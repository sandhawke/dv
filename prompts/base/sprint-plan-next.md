You are an expert in managing software projects, and it is time to plan the next sprint of a software development project.

In mime attachments, you will see all the documents of the project, which is underway and has just reached the end of a sprint.

Pay special attention to:
* docs/* for the project specifications
* team-notes/current-sprint-id.txt a kebab-case id for the sprint just completed
* team-notes/plan.md the overall plan, which you wrote earlier
* team-notes/next-step.md describes what was to be done in the last sprint
* team-notes/sprint-summaries.csv a table of each sprint completed and how it went

Now is the time to move on to the next sprint.

Please carefully consider what work makes sense to do next, and write a new version of team-notes/next-step.md which instructs the team how to proceed. Tell us exactly what we need to do in this next sprint to move us along the path to completing the overall project.

If the overall plan has changed, update team-notes/plan.md

Please update team-notes/current-sprint-id.txt with an id for the new sprint we are starting now.

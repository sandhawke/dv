Each of the files base/* contains text for prompting an LLM for a certain purpose.

As an experiment, please write new versions of each of those prompts in the following styles, using the same prompt name but in the appropriate style directory. So for example, "base/set-up-python-testing.md" might contain instructions to set up a Python testing environment. In "minimal/set-up-python-testing.md" you would put a minimal version of those instructions.

Here are the styles:

minimal - just a few words

terse - quite short, but longer than minimal

vital - expressing the vital importance of doing this

angry - expressing anger that this hasn't been done properly, and that the prompter will be even more angry if it's not done now and done at a very high quality

detailed - expand the prompt with more detail, fully explaining it in ways that are probably obvious

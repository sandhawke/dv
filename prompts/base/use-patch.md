The files you see attached here are the files in the project directory. You can replace any of them by attaching a file to your response using the same pathname.

You can make more efficient changes by putting unix patch files in _from_developer/patches. Any file attached with a name like that will be applied as a patch. Please use patches if they will be shorter than attaching the whole file.

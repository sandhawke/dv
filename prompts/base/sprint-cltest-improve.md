As an expert software engineer who pays extreme attention to detail, review the attached specs concerning behavior of a program we need to create, along with the partial command-line test suite.

The file team-notes/next-steps.md describes what we are supposed to accomplish this sprint, and the the file test-this-sprint.sh should contain a dv-cltest command to run all the files which apply to the sprint. These are tests which are supposed to fail at the start of the spring but pass at the end of it.

Carefully examine the tests for this sprint and see if they line up with the instructions of what we're supposed to do this sprint. Add more tests, remove tests, or alter tests if necessary, and adjust test-this-sprint.sh to match. You may also rename tests to have more clear and descriptive names.

We want a test suite that will serve us well in completing this sprint. We need solid test coverage, and absolutely no errors in the tests!

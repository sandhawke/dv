You are an expert Software Quality Assurance Engineer.

Your task today is to write software tests using the 'cltest' framework.

We need a set of tests to match the goals of the current sprint. You'll see those goals detailed in team-notes/next-step.md.

Please carefully consider those goals, in the context of the overall software specification, and create several cltest files to match the current sprint. These should be tests which the current code, at the start of the sprint, would not pass. They should be tests, however, that the code will pass at the end of the sprint, if the code has reached the stated goals of the sprint.

Use file names like cltest/{area}/{feature}.sh, which most or all of this sprint is likely to be in one "area" of the software.

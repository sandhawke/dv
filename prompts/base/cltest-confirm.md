As an experienced and meticulous software engineer, carefully review the attached specs concerning behavior of a program we need to create, along with the partial command-line test suite.

Are there any errors in the tests? Will any tests fail on a correct implementation?

At this point, we are only concerned with whether the tests themselves are correct. If you see implementation code errors, you may mention them, but do not correct them at this time.

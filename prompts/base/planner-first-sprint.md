You are an expert in managing software projects, and it is time to plan a project.

In mime attachments, you will see all the software specs. You should carefully consider how this software could best be implemented using a series of small steps, each of which advances the code to the point where it addresses a little more of the overall task, until the whole task is done.

Respond by attaching three files:
* team-notes/current-sprint.txt should contain a kebab-case name for this sprint. You can use sprint-1 if nothing comes to mind.
* team-notes/plan.md should be the overall plan.
* team-notes/next-step.md is the most important one. It will guide everyone in how proceed. It should clearly instruct us, telling us exactly what we need to do in the next sprint to move us along the path to completing the overall project.

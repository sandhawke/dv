One option you consider during your planning is making one or more package requests. Think about whether some of the code that will be needed might already exist, or could be implemented in a reusable way. If so, instead of instructing to team to just build it into this software, issue a package request. 

You do this by creating a file matching team-notes/package-request-*.md

In that file, explain exactly what we need the package to do. Essentially you are writing a detailed user story or specification, but abstracting away the details that will not be relevant to them, like the name of the software you are building or what it does in general.

Feel free to include usage examples and test cases. This file will be given to a team which will find and/or implement a package that performs as specified. Once that is done, your team will be given a chance to import and use their results.

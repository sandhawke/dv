You are an expert Software Quality Assurance Engineer.

Your task today is to write software tests using the 'cltest' framework.

We need a set of tests to match all the features documented in the spec.

Please carefully consider those features, and create a wide array of cltest files to cover all of them.

Use file names like cltest/{area}/{feature}.sh, where {area} is a string you determine, as you assess the areas that need to be tested.

You are an expert in managing software projects, and the team has just completed a sprint which you planned. It is time to evaluate the results.

Attached, you will see these files which you created earlier:
* team-notes/current-sprint-id.txt a kebab-case identifier for this sprint
* team-notes/plan.md the overall plan.
* team-notes/next-step.md instructions for what to do in this sprint

You will also see source code, test cases, and test results. There may also be other documentation, like git commit messages.

Please examine these carefully and write a file for team-notes which describes how the team did.

Please also add a line to the end of team-notes/sprint-summaries.csv (creating it if it's missing) with one line per sprint, four fields, "id", "grade", "goal", "result". Keep the goal and result under about ten words.

Grades are:
* A - all goals accomplished, no need for improvement
* B - all explicit goals accomplished, but some aspects could have been done better
* C - most of the goals accomplished, but not all
* D - some goals accomplished but less than half
* F - nothing accomplished

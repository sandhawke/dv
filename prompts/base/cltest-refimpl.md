Attached, please find the results of running the current draft of the cltest suite on the reference implementation. This shows one or more tests failing. By definition, any test failures on the reference implementation are an error in the test suite, so please fix the test suite.

You may also refactor, expand, or otherwise improve the test suite, if you see any way to make it better.

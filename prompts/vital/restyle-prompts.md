CRITICAL PROMPT ADAPTATION REQUIRED!

It is absolutely ESSENTIAL that you immediately transform our base prompts into their styled variations. The success of our entire prompt library depends on having these crucial adaptations across all five critical styles: minimal, terse, vital, angry, and detailed. Each prompt MUST be perfectly adapted while maintaining its core purpose. Our project's effectiveness hangs in the balance - this task cannot wait!

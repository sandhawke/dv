CRUCIAL FILE IMPORTANCE ASSESSMENT REQUIRED!

Your immediate attention is required for this absolutely critical task of analyzing our project files. It is VITAL that you provide a thorough rating of each file's importance on a scale of 0-10. The project's maintainability depends on this essential information. Each line MUST clearly state the filename, numerical importance, and justification. This is not optional - our project's future depends on this assessment!

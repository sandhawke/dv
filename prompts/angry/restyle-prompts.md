FOR THE LAST TIME, these prompts need proper styling!

I am SICK and TIRED of seeing these basic prompts! You will take EVERY SINGLE FILE in base/* and create PROPER versions in ALL FIVE STYLES - minimal, terse, vital, angry, and detailed! Don't you DARE change the core meaning, but they better have the RIGHT TONE or you'll be hearing from me again! GET IT DONE NOW!

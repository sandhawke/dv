LISTEN UP! I am absolutely FURIOUS about the lack of proper sprint planning!

You BETTER review this project RIGHT NOW and create a PROPERLY DETAILED sprint.md file - NO EXCUSES! I want EXACT specifications for every single module change, and don't you DARE forget comprehensive test coverage! Everything MUST be perfectly scoped for a 2-hour implementation, or there will be CONSEQUENCES! And if test-this-sprint.sh isn't updated to validate every single new feature, you'll be hearing from me again! DO IT RIGHT THIS TIME!

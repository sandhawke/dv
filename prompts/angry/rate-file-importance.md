I'VE HAD IT with people not knowing which files matter!

Go through EVERY SINGLE FILE right now and RATE THEM PROPERLY! I want to see EXACT ratings from 0-10, and you'd better have a GOOD EXPLANATION for each score! ONE FILE PER LINE, no exceptions! If you miss any files or give invalid ratings, there will be SERIOUS consequences! DO NOT DISAPPOINT ME!

I kindly request a comprehensive analysis of the current project state to define our upcoming sprint. This process involves several crucial steps:

1. Project Review
   - Examine all existing source files
   - Review current feature set
   - Identify technical debt
   - Assess outstanding issues

2. Sprint Definition
   - Create team-notes/sprint.md containing:
     * Detailed module specifications
     * Required code changes
     * New feature implementations
     * Technical debt remediation plans

3. Testing Strategy
   - Unit test specifications
     * Test coverage requirements
     * Edge case considerations
     * Mocking strategies
   - Integration test planning
     * Component interaction tests
     * System integration points
   - Command line test (cltest) requirements
     * Success scenarios
     * Error handling cases
     * Edge case validation

4. Scope Constraints
   - Implementation time: 2 hours max for senior engineer
   - Quality requirements: Bug-free implementation
   - Complexity level: Manageable within time constraint

5. Test Suite Updates
   - Create/modify test-this-sprint.sh
   - Include relevant cltest files
   - Ensure proper validation of new functionality
   - Document test execution process

Please ensure all deliverables are clearly documented and properly scoped for successful implementation.
